# Python User Interface for Dingo-D Robot
This project involved developing a Python-based interface for teleoperating the Dingo-D robot with a Kinova arm. The interface includes manual and semi-automatic modes, allowing direct control via keyboard or target setting on a map for autonomous navigation. It also provides live video feedback for monitoring
