# Python User Interface for Dingo-D Robot
This project involved developing a Python-based interface for teleoperating the Dingo-D robot with a Kinova arm. The interface includes manual and semi-automatic modes, allowing direct control via keyboard or target setting on a map for autonomous navigation. It also provides live video feedback for monitoring

# Camera and Arm Control Section in the GUI
In this section, the user begins by selecting the operating mode, either simulation or real robot. The user can then monitor the robot's surroundings through the onboard camera, with the option to enable or disable the camera feed. If an AprilTag is detected in the robot's environment, a red rectangle will appear in the top left corner of the GUI to indicate its presence. Additionally, the user can position the robot's arm by selecting one of the predefined positions using the available buttons. However, the interface does not provide feedback to confirm whether the arm has successfully moved to the selected position.
